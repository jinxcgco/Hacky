title: Create a Honeypot using Mana-Toolkit
layout: guide

**Note**: Before starting to create a Honeypot using Mana-Toolkit, you are going
to need two network interfaces, one of them must be in monitor mode and the
other one must have internet access.

# Installing Mana-Toolkit

In order to install mana-toolkit, create a bash file that contains the following
script:

```bash
apt update
apt install build-essential pkg-config git libnl-genl-3-dev libssl-dev
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/sensepost/hostapd-mana
cd hostapd-mana
make -C hostapd
mv /tmp/hostapd-mana/hostapd /usr/lib/mana-toolkit
cd /usr/share
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sensepost/mana.git
mv mana mana-toolkit
mkdir /etc/mana-toolkit
mv mana-toolkit/run-mana/conf/*.conf /etc/mana-toolkit
```

Execute it, wait and once it is finished executing, you'll have mana
installed in your machine.

## Configuring Mana

Once you have your two network interfaces set up and Mana installed, we now have
to modify its settings. Mana settings are stored in a text file, to edit the
settings we are going to open this file, using a normal text editor (such as
Emacs, Vim, Leafpad, etecetera), the path of the file that we want to modify is
`/etc/mana-toolkit/hostapd-mana.conf` so, if we would like to open this file
using Emacs, the command would look like to the following:

```bash
emacs /etc/mana-toolkit/hostapd-mana.conf
```

Once that file is open, you would get such a big file with a lot of settings to
modify. One of the values that we want to change is **interface**, this value
represents the interface that you want to use to broadcast the signal
(basically, the wireless interface in monitor mode).

The next thing you _might_ want to modify is the **ssid**, this is the network
name that will appear when people look for Wi-Fi networks.

The next file that we need to modify is the start script, this is the file that
will start Mana-Toolkit for us, this file's location is
`/usr/share/mana-toolkit/run-mana/start-nat-simple.sh`, again, if you would like
to open up this file using emacs, the command would look like the following:

```bash
emacs /usr/share/mana-toolkit/run-mana/start-nat-simple.sh
```

In this file, there are two main things that you need to modify: **upstream**
which represents the interface that has internet access and **phy** is again,
the interface that is going to broadcast the signal, that is, our wireless
interface in monitor mode.

# Starting Mana-Toolkit

In order to start Mana-Toolkit, all you have to do is to execute the bash script
located at `/usr/share/mana-toolkit/run-mana/start-nat-simple.sh`, we can do
so by executing the following command:

```bash
bash /usr/share/mana-toolkit/run-mana/start-nat-simple.sh
```

Once you execute that command, you'll get a message saying that the Fake access
point is enabled and you can kill it by pressing the "Enter" key.

Sometimes, the first time you run this script it will not know, it will probably
give you an error, it's a good idea to just run the code again, literally the
same command if it fails or if it returns any error.

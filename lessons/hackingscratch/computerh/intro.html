In this section, we are going to learn how to gain access to a computer device.
A computer device means any electronic device like a phone, a laptop, a TV, a
network, a router, a website, a server, etcetera. Each device has an operating
system, and they have programs installed on these operating systems. We will
look at how to gain access to the computers. In this example, we are going to
use a computer. We are going to have a Linux device hacker, and we are going
to have a windows device target. We can apply the same concepts if we are
targeting a web server, a laptop or a phone, but we will be considering them all
just like a normal computer. We can set up a web server on our computer, we can
make it look and act like a website, or even make it act like a TV, or for that
matter, anything we want. TVs and all such things are just simple computers
with less complicated hardware in them.

We are going to learn two types of attacks: Server side and client side attacks.

## Server Side

Server-side attacks does not require any user interaction. These attacks can be
used with web servers. We can also use them against a normal computer that
people use every day. We are going to have a computer, and we will see how we
can gain access to that computer without the need for the user to do anything.
This attack mostly applies to devices, applications and web servers that do
not get used much by people. Basically, people configure them, and they run
automatically. All we have is an IP address. We will see how we can test the
security and gain access to that computer based on that IP. Various types of
server-side attacks includes buffer overflow, SQL Injection and
denial-of-service attacks.

## Client side

The second approach we will try are client-side attacks. This approach requries
the client who uses that computer to do something. It involves several things
like opening a picture, opening a trojan or installing an update. We are going
to learn how to create backdoors, how to create trojans, how to use social
engineering to make the target person do something so that we will gain
access to their computer. In this case, information gathering is going to
be crucial, because we actually need to know the person that we are
targetting. The various types of client-side attacks include session fixation,
content spoofing and cross-site scripting.

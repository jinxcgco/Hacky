A hacker is a person that has the ability to gain access to a system which he is
not supposed to have access. For example, login into an email address which is
supposed you shouldn't be logged in, is considered email hacking. Gain access to
a computer remotely which is supposed you shouldn't have access, it's computer
hacking. To read information that is supposed you shouldn't be reading, again,
it's considered hacking.

There are a lot of ways to hack a system and the word "_hacking_" can be
referred to a lot of things, but the main concept is the same. Gain access or do
things you are supposed not to do.

The three main types of hackers are:

* **Black Hat Hackers**: These are the bad guys. They are known to hack systems
  in an illegal way to obtain/steal money or to cause any other harm.

* **White Hat hackers**: These are the good guys. They use the same techniques
  used by the bad guys and they also hack systems, but they only do it when they
have prior authorisation to test the system's security.

* **Grey hat hackers**: This is a mix of the two other kinds of hackers. They
  will hack any system, regardless of having or not an authorisation, but they
won't steal money nor cause any harm to it and in many cases, they will warn the
sysadmin about the vulnerabilities. That's still illegal, because they are
hacking a system without owning it or without authorisation.

Now... Why should you learn it? Well... Hacking has become an industry, there
are a lot of job opportunities for hackers that test a system's security to make
them more secure and to avoid them to be hacker by the bad guys.

Actually, there's a big demand for hackers as the number of attacks has
increased a lot. Companies like Facebook, Google and Microsoft hire hackers so
they try to hack their products and to fix its vulnerabilities. Also, some
companies have a Bug Bounty system, which allows hackers from every part of the
planet to search for vulnerabilities in their websites and applications, and for
each one of them they found they'll get paid different amounts of money
depending on the danger it represents

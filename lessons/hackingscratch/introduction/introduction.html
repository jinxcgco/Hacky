Welcome to the "Hacking from Scratch" course.

In this course I will teach you hacking from scratch, which means, you won't
need any kind of prior knowledge in order to complete it.

We'll start talking about a Hacking Lab and how you can install the necessary
software so you can test your attacks without damaging any other device.

Once you have your hacking lab we'll begin with the course, which is divided in
the following sections:

* **Network hacking**: In this section you'll learn how do networks work, how
  the devices communicate with each other and how to exploit this kind of
communication to gain control over every single connection on your network,
you'll also learn how to crack passwords, regardless if they use WEP, WPA or
WPA2 and to intercept the data sent to capture usernames, passwords, chat
messages, etcetera... Basically, everything that is made within your same
network.

* **Gaining Access**: In this section you'll learn how to gain access to servers
  and personal computers. First, you'll learn how to gain detailed and
comprehensive information about your target and to discover vulnerabilities.
You'll also learn how to create backdoors and use social engineering techniques
to force your target to execute it making it seem like an update, a PDF, an
image or any other file archive your objective could be interested in.

* **Post Exploitation**: In this section you'll learn what to do once you gained
  access to you target's devices. You'll learn to interact and modify the
filesystem, execute commands remotely, to capture the keys your target presses
on the keyboard, turn on the webcam and even use the compromised device to hack
more devices.

* **Website Hacking**: In this section you'll learn how do websites work, how to
  gain detailed and comprehensive information about them and how to discover and
exploit vulnerabilities that will let you gain complete control over your target
website.

* **Social Engineering**: In this section you'll learn a lot of social
  engineering techniques, how to fool your victim to force them to execute and
install backdoors, how to send emails and modify the sender's address, to create
and deliver malware and what to do once your victim's device has been
compromised.

* **Anonymity**: In this section you'll learn how to remain as anonymous as
  possible when performing an attack, how to enter the DarkNet, how to
communicate and send and receive files anonymously and even how to pay money to
another person in a completely anonymous way.

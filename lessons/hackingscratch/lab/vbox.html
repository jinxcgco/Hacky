In this little lesson, I will teach you how to install BlackArch (the
distribution I will be using throughout this course) in VirtualBox.

First, you'll need to go to its website and click the menu
[Downloads](https://www.blackarch.org/downloads.html), scroll down until you get
the "OVA Images" section and download "_BlackArch Linux 64 bit OVA Image_".

Once its download finishes, you'll open VirtualBox, click the "Import" button
and search for the downloaded file, click next and finally, wait until the
Virtual Machine is finished importing.

If you click the "Settings" button (while the imported Virtual Machine is
selected) you can change the amount of ram and cores of the processor it uses.
Go to "_System_" and change the amount of ram, then go to the "_Processor_"
section and assign the amount of cores that will be used for the BlackArch
machine.

Finally, you can start the virtual machine.

**Note**: The login credentials are **root:blackarch** (username and password
respectively)

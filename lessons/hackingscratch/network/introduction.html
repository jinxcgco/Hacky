The first section we'll get into this course will be the "Network hacking"
section. Why? Because everything is connected to a network. Regardless if your
target is a computer, a server, a company or just a website, all these devices
are connected to a network. With just the fact of being connected to the
internet, you are connected to a network, because the internet is a very big
network of devices. That's why it's so important that you understand how a
network works and the way each connected device communicates with each other at
an early stage of this course.

This section will be divided into three other sections:

* In the first section, we'll talk about all the attacks that you can perform
  without being connected to a network. Basically, all the attacks you can
execute with nothing but a computer, a network interface and a wireless adapter.

* In the next section, we'll talk about the way you can crack WiFi passwords and
  gain access to encrypted networks, regardless if they use WEP, WPA or WPA2.

* Once we have access to the network, we'll get into the third section where
  we'll learn about the attacks that you can execute for both WiFi and Wired
connected devices. In this section you'll learn several powerful attacks that
will allow you to intercept the connections to you current network and capture
everything that is sent there, including usernames, passwords, URLs, chat
messages, etcetera... You'll also learn how to modify the data while it is sent
through the air, which means that you'll have the possibility to control the
requests that the connected clients make, inject code in pages they visit,
etcetera.

Before we can start talking about network hacking, we need to know how does a
network work. We all know that a network usually contains a number of clients
connected to each other, they usually do it to share data or a resource. A good
example of "resource" is the internet, we are connected all the time to a
network in order to access to the internet.

All the networks work in the same way: They have a device which is considered as
server, in many cases, for example, in your house's network that device is the
router (also known as access point "AP"). This access point is actually the only
one who has access to the resources, none of the connected clients has direct
access to it even after connecting to the network. For example, let's suppose
you are connected at a network, you fire up your browser and searched for a
website, what will happen now, is that your computer will send a request to the
router asking for that website, the router has access to the resource (that in
this case is the internet), so it will look for the requested website, once it
gets it, it will return it to your computer and as result, you can see and
navigate through this website.

These data, that is to say, requests and answers are transmitted for each one of
the clients connected in form of packets.

In wireless networks, these packets are transmitted through the air, therefore,
if you have a wireless card and are in the range of these packets, you can
capture the requests and answers, basically, you'll be able to see what all the
devices connected to the network are doing. As they are being sent to the air
until it reaches the access point, you can capture them and see the URLs the
clients are visiting, the usernames and passwords they enter, the chat messages
they send, everything they do will be sent in form of packets, therefore, you'll
be able to capture, analyse them and even modify each single one of these
packets.

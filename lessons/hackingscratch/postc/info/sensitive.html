Nmap is the second program that we are going to look. It is a huge tool and has
several uses. Nmap is used to gather information aboyt any device. Using Nmap,
we can gather information about any client that is within or outside our
network, and we can gather information about clients just by knowing their IP.
Nmap can be used to bypass firewalls, as well as all kinds of protections
and security measures. In this sections, we are going to learn some of the basic
Nmap commands that can be used to discover all clients that are connected to
our network, and also discover the open ports on these clients.

With Nmap we can also specify an IP range as a target, so let's execute a basic
Nmap scan against all my subnet.

The first Nmap scan we are going to execute is called "_Ping Scan_", this scan
will check if a client is alive, by specifying a subnet we can also map
our current network. To execute a ping scan using Nmap against my subnet, just
execute in a terminal:

```bash
jinx@system:~$ nmap -sn 192.168.1.1/24

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.4
Host is up.
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (6 hosts up) scanned in 2.58 seconds
```

As you can see, Nmap returns to us all the connected clients, their MAC address,
their IP address and, potentially, their vendors.

The next scan we are going to learn is called "_Quick Scan_", this is slighlty
slower than the _Ping Scan_, but in Quick Scan, we will get more information
than the _Ping Scan_.

```bash
jinx@system:~$ nmap -F 192.168.1.1/24

```

As you can see, now Nmap shows to use the open ports on each one of the
discovered devices. My router has several open ports, 80, 443, 5000 and
8081 and also, there's a client (192.168.1.4) with an open port "80".

Now, let's take a look at the "_Quick Scan Plus_", which take the "_Quick Scan_"
one step further. It's going to be slower than the "_Quick Scan_", but it will
show us the programs that are running on the open ports and its operating
system.

```bash
jinx@system:~$ nmap -sV -O -F 192.168.1.1/24

As you might remember, in the previous scan we saw that the client "192.168.1.4"
had an open port "80" but we didn't know what service was being executed on that
port, now we know that "192.168.1.4" is a device running linux and executing a
web server "Apache httpd 2.4.38".

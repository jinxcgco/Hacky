In this section, we are going to learn about post-connection attacks. These are
the attacks that you can do after connecting to your target network. It doesn't
matter whether the target network is a WiFi network or a wired network. As long
as you are connected to that network, you'll be able to perform all the attacks
in this section.

Once you are connected to the network you can do so many cool things, you'll be
able to gather much more detailed information about all of the clients connected
to the same network, you'll also be able to intercept data and see any usernames
passwords or any information they put and get from the internet, you'll also be
able to modify that data as it is being sent in the air, that means that you can
inject evil code and do so many other cool things on the network.

To do all of the attacks that are going to be shown in this section, you have
two options:

  * Run all the attacks against a virtual NAT network.
  * Run the attacks against real computers, connected to your real WiFi
  network and you need to make sure that you have a wireless interface
  connected to the Kali machine, and the Kali machine needs to be connected
  to your target WiFi network.

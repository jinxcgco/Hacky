Before diving into this course contents, let's talk about the main topics we are
going to cover in this course, we are going to talk about privacy, anonymity,
the dark web and security.

I chose to cover all of those topics, because they are very related and
sometimes in the internet it's very difficult to achieve one of them without the
others.

_Privacy_ means that no one knows what you do, for example, when you enter your
house, people can see what you did, they know you are in your house but they
don't know what you do inside the house, therefore, you are private.

_Anonymity_ on the other hand, means that people can see what you are doing but
they don't know who you are, for example, let's suppose you are in your house
and you put a mask on and then you leave your house and start washing your car,
people can see there's somebody washing the car, they know what you are doing
but they don't know who is that person washing the car because you are wearing a
mask, therefore, you are hiding your identity.

When you are private, people know who you are but they don't know what you do
and when you are anonymous, people know what you do but they don't know who is
the person doing that activity.

On the internet, usually, we only want to be private as we don't want third
parties to see the emails we send, messages we receive or basically everything
we do online, unfortunately, it is very difficulty to be private on the
internet because in order to use the internet you have to use resources that are
not owned by you, so you have to use an internet service provider (ISP) and when
you access websites or services, you are accessing to the server owned by the
company that hosts what you are visiting, therefore, you cannot control the way
your data is being handled, for example, let's say you try to go to
_google.com_, this request will first go to a number of stops, it will go to
your ISP, it will pass through a number of routers and eventually reaches Google
servers that are not controlled by you and then, you get your response through a
similar route, therefore, all your requests and responses will pass through a
number of stops that you don't control so, everyone working on these stops, a
person or entity that has control over them will be able to see your traffic,
not only that, but hackers, government agencies and several other entities can
intercept and read these requests and responses, therefore, they are able to see
what you are doing and therefore your privacy is gone.

We use encryption whenever possible in order to improve our privacy but like I
said, there will be some points and some situations where it is just not
possible to be private, therefore, the best solution is to try to become as
anonymous as possible so, if anybody manages to intercept our data, they won't
be able to link it to ourselves or our identity, there are some situations where
people actually want to be just anonymous, for example, journalists usually
prefer to publish sensitive posts anonymously so that everybody can see the
post, so it's not hidden, but at the same time it can't be linked to their real
identity, this way, the posts will be linked to some kind of identity so it will
be linked to a fake name or simply just numbers or a ghost profile, but it is
liked to some kind of identity, this is known as pseudo anonymity.

In order to achive the above two things is to become more private and more
anonymous, we are going to need two things: First, we are going to need an
anonymising service that will allow us to become more anonymous and we are going
to need to change our habits when it comes to using online services and use
different services that are more private and more anonymous because the search
engines that you are used to, for example Google and Bing, the emails that you
areused to like GMail and the others and all of the other services that you are
used to are simply nor private nor anonymous, they profile you, they collect
data about you and sometimes they even sell it to third parties, unfortunately,
on the clear net, there aren't a lot of useful services that are private and
anonymous, luckily, the anonymising services that we are going to be using
from point one in order to become more anonymous also contain a number of
services and websites that only exist within this anonymising service or
network, therefore, these are referred to as DarkNet or Dark Web websites or
services. I am going to show you how to properly access the DarkNet and then use
these services to carry out our day to day tasks in a more anonymous and more
private manner.

Last but not least, I also wanted to cover security in this course, because you
cannot be private and anonymous if you are not secure, even if you are using the
best privacy methods, the best anonymity methods, the best VPNs, multiple
proxies and so on, if somebody manages to hack into your computer they will be
able to see all of your files and see your activity, they will be also able to
bypass whatever methods you used to become anonymous and de-anonymise you.

That's why, like I said, you can't really be private and anonymous without being
secure and being private.

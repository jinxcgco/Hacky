Before diving into the course content, I'd like to give you a quick overview of
the content of the course.

As you know, in this course we are going to be covering four main topics:
_Anonymity_, _Privacy_, _DarkNet_ and _Security_.

We will start with anonymity and you are going to be introduced to the TOR
network, which is the anonymising network that we are going to use throughout
the whole course, you are going to learn how it works and how to connect to it
to improve our privacy, anonymity and to access the Dark Web.

We will start with the basics of the Tor Browser, how to properly install it
on Linux, Windows and OS X, configure it for maximum security and anonymity and
bypass censorship to connect to the TOR network even if it's blocked. Once done
with the basics, we will move to the next level where we are going to use and
operating system that is designed to be more private and anonymous. First, I am
going to teach you how to properly configure it and install it on a USB stick so
we can use this USB stick to use this operating system from any computer to
anonymously access both the DarkNet and the Clear Net without affecting this
computer and without leaving any traces on it, then, the course is divided into
a number of subsections or modules that will teach you how to anonymously and
privately use both the Clear Net and the DarkNet, you will also learn how to
carry out your normal online tasks in a more private and more anonymous manner,
you will learn how to search for content on both the Clear Net and the Dark Net,
how to communicate using emails and instant messages, how to share and handle
files, how to use your whole file system and whole computer in a more private,
more secure and a more anonymous manner.

After that, we will have a full section on encryption, where you will learn
about what we mean by asimmetric, symmetric and end-to-end encryption, how to
properly and manually encrypt data, whether it's simple text or files so that
they are useless to anybody that intercepts this data. You will also learn how
to sign data, so the receiver can verify that it was actually sent from you and
how to verify the integrity of data that you receive, this is very important, if
you are serious about protecting your privacy and if you want to communicate
with people on the DarkNet because some people will simply refuse to communicate
with you unless you use encryption the way that I am going to show in that
section.

There is also a full section on cryptocurrencies, because as we know, the
traditional payment methods that we use like PayPal, credit cards or other Clear
Net payment methods aren't neither private or anonymous. In this section, you
are going to learn how cryptocurrencies work, how to obtain them and how to
handle them privately and anonymously.

In the last section of the course, I am going to teach you how to take your
security to the next level by dividing your computer into a number of isolated
security domains so, even if you get hacked or if you get infected by malware,
it would be very difficult for the hacker or for the malware to compromise your
full system and de-anonymise you.
